# Purchase Prediction using Feedforward Neural Network

This project demonstrates how to build and train a simple feedforward neural network (Multi-Layer Perceptron) using Keras to predict whether a user will make a purchase based on:

- Visit Duration
- Number of Pages Visited

Synthetic data is generated using NumPy, and the model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras.

## ðŸ§  Model Overview

- 2 input features
- 1 hidden layer with 10 neurons (ReLU activation)
- 1 output neuron (sigmoid activation for binary classification)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow
python model.py
